Instructions to Run "main_with_MPI.py" Python Program (mpi4py)

These are instructions to run the "main_with_MPI.py" file which uses Python's mpi4py module. If the code is runnable in Pycharm successfully, then please use this file for our grading, otherwise use "code_with_threading". Please follow these steps in order to run the code correctly.

Make Sure Python 3.11.1 is installed. Sometimes the PATH is not set up correctly. Uninstall and reinstall Python. On the installation page, make sure "Use admin privileges when installing py.exe" and "Add python.exe to PATH" are both selected before proceeding with install.

After Python 3.11.1 is installed, run "pip3 install mpi4py" in Command Prompt to install the 'mpi4py' module.

Also install MPI from Microsoft website to properly configure the settings. The link for the download is: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57467.

Download the "Python CSC 113 Project 1" from the ZIP file and right-click on the folder. Click the option to "Open Folder in Pycharm". Make sure the most up-to-date Python interpreter is configured. This should now be 3.11.1. You can now run the "main_with_MPI.py" file.

The original_code.py file is the code we designed for first project assignment earlier in the semester.
